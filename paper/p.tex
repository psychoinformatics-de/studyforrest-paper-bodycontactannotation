Body contact is an important aspect of everyday life, its observation
communicates versatile information about the haptic perception of its physical
aspects, but also about the intent and the emotional status of both the
initiator and the recipient. As such, the perception of body contact is highly
relevant for studying social interactions and the nature of its related
representations in the human brain. Recently, natural stimuli and, in
particular, motion pictures play an increasingly important role in studies
trying to explore the brain’s behavior under conditions of real-life
complexity. Several studies have investigated a publicly available brain
imaging dataset that used the two-hour motion picture “Forrest Gump” for
prolonged stimulation. A number of annotations for this stimulus have been made
available previously, including a description of portrayed emotions. Here we
extend the stimulus annotation with a detailed description of all body contact
events in the movie, in order to enable future studies on the representation
and interaction of physical and social aspects of body contact in natural
settings with near real-life complexity.

\section*{Introduction}
% Rationale for creating the dataset(s) and/or objectives for the experiment
% resulting in the dataset - why the data were gathered or produced.


Most experiments investigate the brain via simplified stimuli that cannot
reflect the complexity of a natural environment. With this project we want to
enable research to study the natural reaction of the human brain. In our
concrete case the body contact is in the spotlight. For observing the body
contact we used the movie „Forrest Gump“. The movie provides us complex
naturalistic stimuli representing real-life contexts better than laboratory
settings.

So far little scientific research regarding interpersonal touch/body contact
exists. Vastly more studies are concerned with the investigation of the
emotional aspects of vision and audition. (e.g. Ekman, 1993; Fecteau et al.,
2007).This is surprisingly because interpersonal touch is present in everyone's
daily life and plays an important role in interactions with other people. The
researcher Tiffany Field even asserts that touch affects us ten times stronger
than verbal or emotional context. (Field, 2001)  

Nevertheless are there some previous studies offering  us initial insights in
the subject.  Some of their  most important achievements concerning body
contact are for example the following ones.

Field (2001) and Spence (2002) detect that body contact plays an important role
in affect our emotional wellbeing. Interpersonal touch is capable of delivering
emotions and inspiring and motivating us sometimes more than words (Jones and
Yarbrough, 1985). An encouraging clap on the shoulder or a reconciling
handshake for example. 

In addition to this Hertenstein et al. (2006) investigated the way how we could
communicate with body contact. They detected that body contact could be used to
confide as many as six different types of emotion.

In other words body contact can be used to communicate emotion similar to that
in audition and vision.

Tiffany Field (2001) even assume that people in the modern society are
suffering from the absence or lack of interpersonal touch. This phenomenon
bears the significant name “touch hunger”.

Another interesting notice is that the eye contact whether or not we also touch
our counterpart at the same time can mean very different  things (Field, 2001).

Fischer et al. (1976) had a focus on an other aspect of the topic. The aim of
his studies was to consider the question whether interpersonal tactile
stimulation can influence others social behaviors regardless of the body
contact itself can be remembered consciously. According to his results it is
quite possible.

In summary it can be said that previous studies already provided us meaningful
cognitions but the research area for body contact is an ample field and because
of that still exist lots of open interesting questions and uninvestigated
sections.  One lack of research is for example the question how the tactile
aspects of tactile communication collude with visual and auditory aspects of
our surroundings. (Finnegan; 2005)

The aim of this study was to analyse the information contained in the movie
concerning the body contact for the purpose of facilitate further
investigations of the already published data. Furthermore we tried to get
insights in the topic of deriving and predicting the relationship of people by
means of their body contact.
