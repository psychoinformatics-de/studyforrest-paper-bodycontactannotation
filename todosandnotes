removing 1,4 or 5 improves ratings removing multiples makes them worse so problem is probably not just one person

actor/recp are sometimes swapped

arm/hand/back back/shoulder is one giant mess
nape/neck aswell

confusion between positive and strong positive especially on actors side

intensity rating is probably confound with emotional arousal with obs 1
there are a lot of events that only one or two observers listed
obs 3,5,6 only have flat seconds -> this makes for a lot of 0 duration events
-> excluding them does not improve data quality

1 and 2 rarely use multiple bodypart tags

half of the labels are all over the place aswell

obs 6 (kathleen) is missing body parts
-> used different tags haende,schultern,arme,fuesse, gesäß, hüfte,beine (umlaute, plural)
	-> this is easy to fix
-> has super fucked up format
instead of seperating multiple bodyparts with spaces she uses semicolons and uses "" for a single entry
 	-> this is gonna be a bit harder

actor/recp confusions only occur when people are unsure if one or both guys initiated the touch

Solutions?:
make body part labels more streamlined (e.g. upper body, lower body, head, arms, legs)
maybe drop the emotional arousal part of valence since its pretty unreliable anyways and just do positive/negative
fix kathleens data by changing the convert script

some events are there in mutiple annotations but have no temporal overlap since they are short and are shifted a couple of seconds (this seems to happen without a pattern and over all observers)
-> this may happen because people have flat seconds
